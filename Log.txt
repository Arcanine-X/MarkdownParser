37 30180324 15:00  Trying to figure out how to write makefile - couldn't figure it out, not junit core apparantley. Going to put jar into gitlab instead

45 30180325 1300-1800 Refactoring, fixing bash script, adding comments and making code prettier

Total hours 45 hours-ish.

The makefile really wasted alot of time for me. I kept getting errors to do with not being able to find a junit core. So just resulted in putting
a .jar file into gitlab which I think is the easiest way around it.
