# This is a simple header

# This is a header with *italics* and **bolds**

## This is a h2 header with *italics* and **bolds**

This is a normal paragraph

This is a paragraph
that goes over
multiple lines.

1. This is a list
2. With multiple items
3. that can actually
go over multiple lines
4. but there is

* also a bullet point list
* which can also have items
* as you can see
which can also
go over multiple lines which is pretty fantastic
# This is just a random header to demonstrate it breaks out of the list

> Block quotes are pretty cool took

---

That was a separator

There is also `inline code` which is also very cool

```
This is a block *code* with few tricky
# tests
```

The output of this **acceptance test** will be *compared* to the
common mark dingus output. I hope this matches **because **if it does **that
means** my *output* was** all** correct, I just did some nested bolds and italics
to demonstrate that also works. Have a good day.
