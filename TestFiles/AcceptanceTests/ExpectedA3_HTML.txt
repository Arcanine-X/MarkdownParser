<p><strong>This <em>is <strong>the <em>third <strong>acceptance
test</strong> because</em> you</strong> need</em> six</strong> acceptance tests atleast
<code>for a good project.</code></p>
<hr />
<p>I will try to demonstrate everything again</p>
<ol>
<li>Such as italics</li>
<li>and bolds</li>
<li>and everything else
such as multiline things</li>
</ol>
<h1>Where lists become headers</h1>
<pre><code>Block code is pretty interesting
A block code shouldn't have *italics* or **bolds**
so I guess my program is functioning correctly
</code></pre>
<p>I will do more <code>inline</code> <code>code to demonstrate that it
works as intended
over multiple</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a different list</li>
<li>Because it has bullet points</li>
<li>And not numbers 2. this is a trick
which my program didn't fall for and so
is # this</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A block quote
over multiple lines</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Where it stops being a quote when it sees a header</h1>
