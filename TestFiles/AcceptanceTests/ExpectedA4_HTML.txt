<h1>This is the fourth acceptance test</h1>
<p>**I <em>really</em> am running <strong>out <strong>of things
to</strong> test</strong> <em>because</em> I feel like I have tested it</p>
<h2>Header doesnt become a paragraph which is good</h2>
<p>Lets try test the same thing with other key words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A block quoote</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we can try</p>
<pre><code>Block code shouldnt become paragraph
</code></pre>
<p>And now some</p>
<ol>
<li>List shouldnt become a paragraph either</li>
</ol>
<p>And lastly</p>
<ul>
<li>Bullet points shouldnt become paragraphs</li>
</ul>
<p>This all works
with my parser which I **am <strong>glad</strong></p>
