**This *is **the *third **acceptance
test** because* you** need* six** acceptance tests atleast
`for a good project.` 

---

I will try to demonstrate everything again
1. Such as italics
2. and bolds
3. and everything else
such as multiline things
# Where lists become headers

```
Block code is pretty interesting
A block code shouldn't have *italics* or **bolds**
so I guess my program is functioning correctly
```

I will do more `inline` `code to demonstrate that it
works as intended
over multiple` 

* This is a different list
* Because it has bullet points
* And not numbers 2. this is a trick
which my program didn't fall for and so 
is # this

> A block quote
over multiple lines
# Where it stops being a quote when it sees a header
