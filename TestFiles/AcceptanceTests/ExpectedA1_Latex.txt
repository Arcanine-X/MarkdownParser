\subsection{This is a h2 header with \textit{italics} and \textbf{bolds}}
This is a normal paragraph \par
This is a paragraph
that goes over
multiple lines. \par
\begin{enumerate}
\item This is a list
\item With multiple items
\item that can actually
go over multiple lines
\item but there is
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item also a bullet point list
\item which can also have items
\item as you can see
which can also
go over multiple lines which is pretty fantastic
\end{itemize}
\section{This is just a random header to demonstrate it breaks out of the list}
\begin{quote}
Block quotes are pretty cool took \par
\end{quote}
\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}
That was a separator \par
There is also \lstinline{inline code} which is also very cool \par
\begin{lstlisting}
This is a block *code* with few tricky
# tests
\end{lstlisting}
The output of this \textbf{acceptance test} will be \textit{compared} to the
common mark dingus output. I hope this matches \textbf{because \textbf{if it does \textbf{that
means} my \textit{output} was} all} correct, I just did some nested bolds and italics
to demonstrate that also works. Have a good day. \par
