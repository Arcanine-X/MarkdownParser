<h1>This is a simple header</h1>
<h1>This is a header with <em>italics</em> and <strong>bolds</strong></h1>
<h2>This is a h2 header with <em>italics</em> and <strong>bolds</strong></h2>
<p>This is a normal paragraph</p>
<p>This is a paragraph
that goes over
multiple lines.</p>
<ol>
<li>This is a list</li>
<li>With multiple items</li>
<li>that can actually
go over multiple lines</li>
<li>but there is</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>also a bullet point list</li>
<li>which can also have items</li>
<li>as you can see
which can also
go over multiple lines which is pretty fantastic</li>
</ul>
<h1>This is just a random header to demonstrate it breaks out of the list</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Block quotes are pretty cool took</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>That was a separator</p>
<p>There is also <code>inline code</code> which is also very cool</p>
<pre><code>This is a block *code* with few tricky
# tests
</code></pre>
<p>The output of this <strong>acceptance test</strong> will be <em>compared</em> to the
common mark dingus output. I hope this matches <strong>because <strong>if it does <strong>that
means</strong> my <em>output</em> was</strong> all</strong> correct, I just did some nested bolds and italics
to demonstrate that also works. Have a good day.</p>
