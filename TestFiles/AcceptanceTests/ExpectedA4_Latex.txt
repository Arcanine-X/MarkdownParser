\section{This is the fourth acceptance test}
**I \textit{really} am running \textbf{out \textbf{of things
to} test} \textit{because} I feel like I have tested it \par
\subsection{Header doesnt become a paragraph which is good}
Lets try test the same thing with other key words \par
\begin{quote}
A block quoote \par
\end{quote}
Now we can try \par
\begin{lstlisting}
Block code shouldnt become paragraph
\end{lstlisting}
And now some \par
\begin{enumerate}
\item List shouldnt become a paragraph either
\end{enumerate}
And lastly \par
\begin{itemize}
\item Bullet points shouldnt become paragraphs
\end{itemize}
This all works
with my parser which I **am \textbf{glad} \par
