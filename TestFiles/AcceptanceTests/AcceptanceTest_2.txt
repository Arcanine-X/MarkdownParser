**This *is* **another
acceptance** *test just* *to* *further
*demonstrate* my* program**

1. An item in a list
# Breaks out of lists when it sees a header
2. An item in a list
> Breaks out of lists when it sees a block quote
3. An item in a list
```
Breaks out of lists when it sees block code
```
4. And you can have *italics* and **bold** in lists and a matter of
fact some `inline code`

This also all works with bullet point lists as you can see

* An item in a list
# See it breaks out of lists when it sees a header
* An item in a list
> and also breaks out when it sees a block quote
* An item in a list
```
and also it breaks out when it sees block code
```
* And you can have *italics* and **bold** in lists and also
some `inline code`
see it all works with bullet point lists too

# A header that has open *italics
with a paragraph that has closing* doesn't make everything italics which is cool

---

Just a random separator followed by some block code

```
Block code
over multiple lines
*without astrixes* affecting
**anything** and `inline code` doesn't effect the block
code which is good
```

Just some `inline code`

## And we can finish with a empty block quote
